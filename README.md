Personal Website/Portfolio

# Live Site

https://inez-escandon.herokuapp.com/

## Description

This website is designed to function as a portfolio of my coding/programming work during this bootcamp. It's purpose is to help organize important materials such as portfolio, contact info, and resume to make it easy to learn about and contact me.

The website is designed mostly to be informative. Bright pictures are meant to attract viewers. Large headers and concise texts are meant to present the information simple and effectively. To add some interactivity, links on the nav bar can be clicked on to be directed towards a different page. CSS is bright and colorful and easy to read. Additionally alt tags have been added to allow this website to be accesible to all.
